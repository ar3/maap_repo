* Squads serve the customer
* IC's serve the squad... making sure they bring their full self to the quest of continuous value delivery AND continuous improvement of daily work
* Managers serve the IC's... making sure they have what they need to do what they do best every day... and  they have opportunities to learn and grow. 
* Directors serve a function... making sure that strategy and organizational design puts everyone in the best position to continuously deliver value that customers love â€“ and work for the business. 
  * Directors ensure those within your function are put a position to win. 
  * Directors ensure those that interact with your function come to expect true collaboration; meaning they know they can ask for help, they know those in your function will ask for help when needed, and they look forward to pursuing opportunities together. 


As a director, the expectation is that you are working within a strategy, but with little guidance on the specifics. But you thrive in this ambiguity. You not only get shit done, but you make sure everyone is working together to continuously get shit done a bit better every day.
